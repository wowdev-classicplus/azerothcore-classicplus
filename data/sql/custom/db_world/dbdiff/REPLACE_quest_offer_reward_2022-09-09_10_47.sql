I leave these words here that any a passerby would know; here lies Ehyr-aan, my good friend, the mightiest dwarf, and the first to lay bear to me their famed hospitality, keen sense of humor, and endless appetite for craftsmanship.

It was a vicious frost that led me to Ehry, for as I crossed the rugged mountain passes north of ironforge, I was abandoned mid trail as my guide took flight to escape the deathly gale. I huddled in a crook of the mountainside, desperate to make a fire, and as the spark of flint and steel breathed a shred of tender life to tinder, my near frozen and crooked fingers fumbled, and I snuffed the light out.

I would have surely died there that day, a frozen visage of horror had Ehry-an and his mighty bear not found me and pried me clear of the frozen mountain rock.

Though they were a people of little means, him and his wife Kyrolin nursed my elven frailty back to health. I could barely hobble with crutches under arm before we walked the halls of the great mountain keep of ironforge. I will never foget how the warmth of its great furnacces battered off the chilling mountain air, and what a sight it must have been, a frostbitten Elf led by a most beaming dwarf, regaleing passionately the legends of his great people. As elegant and true as the craftsmanship of my kin may be, I had never seen nor felt a more flawless surface then those carved into the mountain halls of ironforge.

It has since been many years, and I still weep for my long lost friend. If, dear passerby, you find yourself crossing the hills of Dun Morogh, you may happen upon a valley in the mountainside where the air sits oddly still and the ancient hills sing. It is not far west of the capital of my dwarvish brother, and it is the place that we met on that fateful day.

Please, place a small stone cairn for him in honor of his memory. I fear that beyond these carven words his name will inevitably be lost to the centuries.

- For Ehyr-aan,
Ande''thoras-ethil.', 0)
